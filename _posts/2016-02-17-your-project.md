**Your feelings. Your heritage**

Touch, feel, share your fondest memories.

Your memories are precious; they shouldn't lie sleeping on a hard disk. Turn them into valuable treasures that preserve those emotions intact when you hold them in your hands.

I professionally produce your albums and prints with the world's most renowned printing houses, utilizing the most beautiful material and applying the greatest of care. I offer you all that your imagination can conceive, from the layout on the page to the paper, covers and cases.

Be confident that in the years to come you will still be able to relive those special moments in your life as if they had just happened yesterday.

**You are special**

A photo, which can portray the authenticity of the event and the people experiencing that magical moment, is only possible through an intimate connection between you and the photographer you choose. I will dutifully meet you as many times as is necessary to provide you with images that represent the true you.

I guarantee you high-quality service, providing you all the care and attention that you expect, from our first meeting right through to the final delivery.

I work between Luxembourg, France and Belgium, but I can accompany you anywhere --- to Rome, Miami or any destination of your choosing.
